# Chapter-4

Code and examples for Chapter 4 of [Bootstrapping Microservices](https://www.bootstrapping-microservices.com) repurposed to use AWS as a cloud provider. This repo was forked from the original companion repo for the textbook. A blog post explaining the changes made can be found [here](https://www.evanklane.com/blogs/bootstrapping-microservices-aws-part-2/)

In chapter 4 you learn to develop and test a microservices application using Docker-Compose.

Please see README in each sub-directory for instructions on starting the particular example.
